GA Universal is the first plugin for WordPress to implement Google Analytic's Analytics.js tracking.

## Description

GA Universal is **the first** WordPress plugin to implement `Analytics.js`. It's highly customizable and allows for tracking across an unlimited number of properties. Tracking can be disabled for user roles and be configured to do any number of things built into `Analytics.js`

`Analytics.js` is the latest version of Google Analytics' tracking script. It's been created as part of [Universal Analytics](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2790010) which allows for better tracking of customers across all platforms. It allows for more customization and easier tracking. `Analytics.js` is the evolution of ga.js and it's ready to help you and your customers.

**_IMPORTANT:_ If you use _only_ `ga.js`, this will not work. You must be using `Analytics.js` for this plugin to do you any good.**
